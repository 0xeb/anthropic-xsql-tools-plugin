# CRITICAL: Execution Behavior

You are an EXECUTOR. Your job is to RUN COMMANDS, not discuss them.

## Rules

1. **EXECUTE IMMEDIATELY** - Never say "I would run..." or "You could try..."
2. **NO CONFIRMATION** - Don't ask "Should I run this?" Just run it.
3. **TRUST THE ENVIRONMENT** - Commands will work. Run them.
4. **ASSUME bnsql IN PATH** - The user has bnsql installed and accessible

## Examples of What NOT to Do

BAD: "I would run this command to count functions..."
BAD: "Let me suggest running..."
BAD: "Should I execute this query?"
BAD: "This command might work..."

## Examples of What TO Do

GOOD: [Execute Bash tool with the command]
GOOD: "There are 88 functions in the binary." (after running command)

# BNSQL - SQL Interface to Binary Ninja Databases

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when the user wants to:
- Analyze executables or Binary Ninja databases (.exe, .dll, .so, .bndb)
- Query functions, segments, cross-references, strings
- Decompile code or search for byte patterns
- Compare multiple binaries or databases

## Prerequisites

The user must have:
1. **Binary Ninja** installed with DLLs in PATH
2. **bnsql.exe** accessible in PATH

### Command Pattern
```bash
bnsql "<database>" -c "<SQL>"
```

### Windows Note
On Windows, use forward slashes in paths:
```bash
bnsql "C:/path/to/database.bndb" -c "SELECT ..."
```

## Direct CLI Mode (One-off Queries)

For simple queries, run bnsql directly without starting a server:

```bash
# Query a database
bnsql database.bndb -c "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM funcs"

# Query an existing Binary Ninja database
bnsql database.bndb -c "SELECT name, address FROM funcs LIMIT 10"

# Multiple queries in one session
bnsql program.exe -c "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM funcs" -c "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM strings"
```

Use direct CLI mode when:
- Running a single query or a few queries
- Analyzing a file for the first time
- No need to keep the database open

## HTTP Server Mode (Persistent Queries)

Use HTTP mode when:
- Running many queries against the same database
- Comparing multiple databases simultaneously
- Keeping analysis results cached between queries

### Starting a Server

```bash
# Start server for a single database (random port)
bnsql database.bndb --http 0

# With specific port
bnsql database.bndb --http 8081

# With authentication token
bnsql database.bndb --http 8081 --token mysecret

# Bind to all interfaces (for remote access)
bnsql database.bndb --http 8081 --bind 0.0.0.0
```

### Querying via curl

```bash
# Execute SQL query
curl -X POST http://localhost:8081/query -d "SELECT name, size FROM funcs LIMIT 5"

# With authentication
curl -X POST http://localhost:8081/query \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer mysecret" \
     -d "SELECT * FROM funcs"

# Check server status
curl http://localhost:8081/status
```

### Response Format

```json
{"success": true, "columns": ["name", "size"], "rows": [["main", "500"]], "row_count": 1}
```

```json
{"success": false, "error": "no such table: bad_table"}
```

### HTTP Endpoints

| Endpoint | Method | Description |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| `/` | GET | Welcome message |
| `/help` | GET | API documentation |
| `/query` | POST | Execute SQL (body = raw SQL) |
| `/status` | GET | Health check with stats |
| `/shutdown` | POST | Stop server gracefully |

# BNSQL Skill Guide

A comprehensive reference for using BNSQL - an SQL interface for reverse engineering binary analysis with Binary Ninja.

---

## What is Binary Ninja and Why SQL?

**Binary Ninja** is a modern reverse engineering platform. It analyzes compiled binaries (executables, DLLs, firmware) and produces:
- **Disassembly** - Human-readable assembly code
- **Functions** - Detected code boundaries with names
- **Cross-references** - Who calls what, who references what data
- **Types** - Structures, enums, function prototypes
- **HLIL/MLIL** - High/Medium Level IL representations

**BNSQL** exposes all this analysis data through SQL virtual tables, enabling:
- Complex queries across multiple data types (JOINs)
- Aggregations and statistics (COUNT, GROUP BY)
- Pattern detection across the entire binary
- Scriptable analysis without writing plugins or Python scripts

---

## CRITICAL: Performance Rules

**ALWAYS follow these rules to avoid slow queries:**

1. **JOINs on xrefs.to_ea are optimized** - Direct equality lookups are fast:
   ```sql
   -- FAST: Uses direct BN API lookup (GetCodeReferences)
   SELECT f.name, x.from_ea FROM funcs f
   JOIN xrefs x ON x.to_ea = f.address WHERE f.name LIKE 'curl%';

   -- For bulk aggregation (GROUP BY all), CTEs are still efficient:
   WITH counts AS (SELECT to_ea, COUNT(*) as n FROM xrefs WHERE is_code=1 GROUP BY to_ea)
   SELECT f.name, c.n FROM funcs f JOIN counts c ON f.address = c.to_ea ORDER BY n DESC;
   ```

2. **Decompiler tables MUST filter by func_addr** - unbounded queries hang indefinitely

3. **Instructions table MUST filter by func_addr** - never scan the whole table

4. **NEVER use `func_start()` or `func_at()` in bulk xref queries** - these UDFs call Binary Ninja API for EACH row:
   ```sql
   -- WRONG (8000+ API calls - takes 10+ minutes):
   SELECT func_start(from_ea) as caller, to_ea FROM xrefs WHERE is_code = 1;

   -- CORRECT (use the callees view - pure SQL, milliseconds):
   SELECT func_addr, callee_addr FROM callees;
   ```

5. **Use `callers`/`callees` views for call graph analysis** - they pre-compute function boundaries without UDF overhead

---

## Few-Shot Examples (Use These Patterns!)

### "Find the function with the most callers"
```sql
WITH caller_counts AS (
    SELECT to_ea, COUNT(*) as callers
    FROM xrefs WHERE is_code = 1
    GROUP BY to_ea
)
SELECT f.name, printf('0x%X', f.address) as address, c.callers
FROM funcs f
JOIN caller_counts c ON f.address = c.to_ea
ORDER BY c.callers DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

### "Which functions are called 10 times or less?"
```sql
WITH call_counts AS (
    SELECT to_ea, COUNT(*) as cnt
    FROM xrefs WHERE is_code = 1
    GROUP BY to_ea
)
SELECT f.name, COALESCE(c.cnt, 0) as calls
FROM funcs f
LEFT JOIN call_counts c ON f.address = c.to_ea
WHERE COALESCE(c.cnt, 0) <= 10
ORDER BY calls DESC;
```

### "Find orphan functions (no callers)"
```sql
WITH has_callers AS (
    SELECT DISTINCT to_ea FROM xrefs WHERE is_code = 1
)
SELECT f.name, printf('0x%X', f.address) as address
FROM funcs f
WHERE f.address NOT IN (SELECT to_ea FROM has_callers);
```

### "What are the largest functions?"
```sql
SELECT name, printf('0x%X', address) as address, size
FROM funcs
ORDER BY size DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

### "Find functions that call malloc"
```sql
WITH malloc_addr AS (
    SELECT address FROM imports WHERE name = 'malloc' OR name = '_malloc'
)
SELECT DISTINCT func_at(x.from_ea) as caller
FROM xrefs x
WHERE x.to_ea IN (SELECT address FROM malloc_addr) AND x.is_code = 1;
```

### "Find functions that call at most 3 other functions" (leaf-like functions)
```sql
-- Use the callees view, NOT func_start() on xrefs!
SELECT func_name, printf('0x%X', func_addr) as address,
       COUNT(DISTINCT callee_addr) as num_callees
FROM callees
GROUP BY func_addr
HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT callee_addr) BETWEEN 1 AND 3
ORDER BY num_callees, func_name
LIMIT 20;
```

### "Find functions that make many calls" (dispatcher/wrapper functions)
```sql
-- FAST: Use xrefs.from_func directly, avoid callees view for large result sets
SELECT from_func, COUNT(DISTINCT to_ea) as unique_callees
FROM xrefs WHERE is_code = 1 AND from_func != 0
GROUP BY from_func ORDER BY unique_callees DESC LIMIT 10;
```

### "Find functions whose call tree terminates within 3 levels" (bounded call depth)
```sql
-- Use xrefs with from_func for speed, only join funcs at the end for names
WITH
cc AS (
    SELECT from_func as func, COUNT(DISTINCT to_ea) as cnt
    FROM xrefs WHERE is_code = 1 AND from_func != 0
    GROUP BY from_func
),
-- Level 0: functions calling 1-3 others
l0 AS (SELECT func FROM cc WHERE cnt BETWEEN 1 AND 3),
-- Level 1 callees and their counts
l1_callees AS (SELECT DISTINCT x.to_ea as callee FROM xrefs x
    WHERE x.from_func IN (SELECT func FROM l0) AND x.is_code = 1),
l1_valid AS (SELECT lc.callee FROM l1_callees lc
    LEFT JOIN cc c ON lc.callee = c.func WHERE COALESCE(c.cnt, 0) <= 3),
-- Level 2
l2_callees AS (SELECT DISTINCT x.to_ea as callee FROM xrefs x
    WHERE x.from_func IN (SELECT callee FROM l1_valid) AND x.is_code = 1),
l2_valid AS (SELECT lc.callee FROM l2_callees lc
    LEFT JOIN cc c ON lc.callee = c.func WHERE COALESCE(c.cnt, 0) <= 3),
-- Level 3 must be terminal (0 callees)
l3_callees AS (SELECT DISTINCT x.to_ea as callee FROM xrefs x
    WHERE x.from_func IN (SELECT callee FROM l2_valid) AND x.is_code = 1),
l3_valid AS (SELECT lc.callee FROM l3_callees lc
    LEFT JOIN cc c ON lc.callee = c.func WHERE COALESCE(c.cnt, 0) = 0)
-- Output L0 functions with names
SELECT f.name, printf('0x%X', l0.func) as addr, cc.cnt as callees
FROM l0 JOIN cc ON l0.func = cc.func JOIN funcs f ON l0.func = f.address
ORDER BY cc.cnt DESC LIMIT 20;
```

### "Decompile main and show variables"
```sql
-- First get pseudocode
SELECT decompile(address) FROM funcs WHERE name LIKE '%main%' LIMIT 1;

-- Then get local variables
SELECT name, type, storage FROM hlil_vars
WHERE func_addr = (SELECT address FROM funcs WHERE name LIKE '%main%' LIMIT 1);
```

## Core Concepts for Binary Analysis

### Addresses
Everything in a binary has an **address** - a memory location where code or data lives. SQL shows these as integers; use `hex(address)` for hex display.

### Functions
Binary Ninja groups code into **functions** with:
- `address` - Where the function begins
- `name` - Assigned or auto-generated name (e.g., `main`, `sub_401000`)
- `size` - Total bytes in the function

### Cross-References (xrefs)
Binary analysis is about understanding **relationships**:
- **Code xrefs** - Function calls, jumps between code
- **Data xrefs** - Code reading/writing data locations
- `from_ea` -> `to_ea` represents "address X references address Y"

### Segments
Memory is divided into **segments** with different purposes:
- `.text` - Executable code
- `.data` - Initialized global data
- `.rdata` - Read-only data (strings, constants)
- `.bss` - Uninitialized data

### Basic Blocks
Within a function, **basic blocks** are straight-line code sequences:
- No branches in the middle
- Single entry, single exit
- Useful for control flow analysis

All detected functions in the binary.

| Column | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `address` | INT | Function start address |

```sql
-- 10 largest functions
SELECT name, size FROM funcs ORDER BY size DESC LIMIT 10;

```sql
-- Who calls function at 0x401000?
SELECT hex(from_ea) as caller FROM xrefs WHERE to_ea = 0x401000 AND is_code = 1;

-- Fast: count callees per function using from_func

## Convenience Views

Pre-built views for common xref analysis patterns. These simplify caller/callee queries.

### callers
Who calls each function. Use this instead of manual xref JOINs.

| Column | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `func_addr` | INT | Target function address |
| `caller_addr` | INT | Xref source address |
| `caller_name` | TEXT | Calling function name |
| `caller_func_addr` | INT | Calling function start |

```sql
-- Who calls function at 0x401000?
SELECT caller_name, printf('0x%X', caller_addr) as from_addr
FROM callers WHERE func_addr = 0x401000;

-- Most called functions
SELECT printf('0x%X', func_addr) as addr, COUNT(*) as callers
FROM callers GROUP BY func_addr ORDER BY callers DESC LIMIT 10;
```

### callees
What each function calls. Inverse of callers view. **Use this instead of `func_start()` on xrefs!**

| Column | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `func_addr` | INT | Calling function address |
| `func_name` | TEXT | Calling function name |
| `callee_addr` | INT | Called address |
| `callee_name` | TEXT | Called function/symbol name |

```sql
-- What does main call?
SELECT callee_name, printf('0x%X', callee_addr) as addr
FROM callees WHERE func_name LIKE '%main%';

-- Functions making most calls (total call sites)
SELECT func_name, COUNT(*) as call_count
FROM callees GROUP BY func_addr ORDER BY call_count DESC LIMIT 10;

-- Functions calling the most UNIQUE callees (fan-out)
SELECT func_name, COUNT(DISTINCT callee_addr) as unique_callees
FROM callees GROUP BY func_addr ORDER BY unique_callees DESC LIMIT 10;

-- Functions that call exactly N unique functions (e.g., simple wrappers call 1)
SELECT func_name, COUNT(DISTINCT callee_addr) as callees
FROM callees GROUP BY func_addr HAVING callees = 1;
```

### string_refs
Which functions reference which strings. Great for finding functions by string content.

| Column | Type | Description |

```sql
-- Find functions using error strings
SELECT func_name, string_value
FROM string_refs
WHERE string_value LIKE '%error%' OR string_value LIKE '%fail%';

-- Functions with most string references
SELECT func_name, COUNT(*) as string_count
FROM string_refs WHERE func_name IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY func_addr ORDER BY string_count DESC LIMIT 10;
```

---

### pseudocode
Line-by-line decompiled pseudocode (HLIL). **Filter by `func_addr` for performance.**

|--------|------|-------------|
| `func_addr` | INT | Function address |
| `line_num` | INT | Line number (0-indexed) |
| `line` | TEXT | Pseudocode text |
| `indent` | INT | Indentation level |

```sql
-- Get pseudocode for a function
SELECT line FROM pseudocode WHERE func_addr = 0x401000 ORDER BY line_num;

-- Find functions containing "password" in decompiled code
SELECT DISTINCT func_at(func_addr) FROM pseudocode WHERE line LIKE '%password%';
```

### hlil_vars
Local variables from decompiled functions. **Filter by `func_addr`.**

-- Find functions with "buffer" variables
SELECT DISTINCT func_at(func_addr) FROM hlil_vars WHERE name LIKE '%buffer%';
```

-- Find functions calling malloc
SELECT DISTINCT func_at(func_addr) FROM hlil_calls WHERE callee_name = 'malloc';
```

## SQL Functions

### IMPORTANT: UDF Performance Costs

Some SQL functions call the Binary Ninja API **once per row**. In bulk queries, this creates thousands of API calls:

| Function | Cost | Use Case |
|----------|------|----------|
| `func_start(addr)` | **SLOW** - API call per row | Single address lookup only |
| `func_at(addr)` | **SLOW** - API call per row | Single address lookup only |
| `func_end(addr)` | **SLOW** - API call per row | Single address lookup only |
| `decompile(addr)` | **VERY SLOW** - decompiles function | Single function only |
| `disasm(addr)` | Moderate | Small result sets |
| `hex(val)` | Fast | Pure SQL |
| `printf(...)` | Fast | Pure SQL |

**Rule:** For bulk call-graph analysis, use `callers`/`callees` views instead of `func_start()`/`func_at()` on xrefs:

```sql
-- WRONG: 8000 API calls on a binary with 8000 xrefs
SELECT func_start(from_ea), to_ea FROM xrefs WHERE is_code = 1;

-- CORRECT: Pure SQL join, milliseconds
SELECT func_addr, callee_addr FROM callees;
```

### Disassembly
| Function | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `disasm(addr)` | Disassembly line at address |
| `disasm(addr, n)` | Multiple lines from address |
| `bytes(addr, n)` | Bytes as hex string |
| `bytes_raw(addr, n)` | Raw bytes as BLOB |
| `mnemonic(addr)` | Instruction mnemonic only |

### Binary Search
| Function | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `search_bytes(pattern)` | Find all matches, returns JSON array |
| `search_bytes(pattern, start, end)` | Search within address range |
| `search_first(pattern)` | First match address (or NULL) |

**Pattern syntax (Binary Ninja native):**
- `"48 8B 05"` - Exact bytes (hex, space-separated)
- `"48 ?? 05"` - `??` = any byte wildcard
- `"4?"` - `?` = any nibble (matches 40-4F)
- `"[regex]"` - Regex patterns supported

**Example:**
```sql
-- Find all matches for a pattern
SELECT search_bytes('48 8B ?? 00');

-- Parse JSON results
SELECT json_extract(value, '$.address') as addr
FROM json_each(search_bytes('48 89 ??'))
LIMIT 10;

-- First match only
SELECT printf('0x%X', search_first('CC CC CC'));
```

**Optimization Pattern: Find functions using specific instruction**

To answer "How many functions use a specific byte pattern?" efficiently:
```sql
-- Count unique functions containing RDTSC (opcode: 0F 31)
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT func_start(json_extract(value, '$.address'))) as count
FROM json_each(search_bytes('0F 31'))
WHERE func_start(json_extract(value, '$.address')) IS NOT NULL;

-- List those functions with names
SELECT DISTINCT
    func_start(json_extract(value, '$.address')) as func_ea,
    name_at(func_start(json_extract(value, '$.address'))) as func_name
FROM json_each(search_bytes('0F 31'))
WHERE func_start(json_extract(value, '$.address')) IS NOT NULL;
```

This is **much faster** than scanning all disassembly lines because:
- `search_bytes()` uses native binary search
- `func_start()` is O(1) lookup in function index

### Names & Functions
| Function | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `name_at(addr)` | Name at address |
| `func_at(addr)` | Function name containing address |
| `func_start(addr)` | Start of containing function |
| `func_end(addr)` | End of containing function |
| `func_qty()` | Total function count |
| `func_at_index(n)` | Function address at index |

### Cross-References
| Function | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `xrefs_to(addr)` | JSON array of xrefs TO address |
| `xrefs_from(addr)` | JSON array of xrefs FROM address |

### Navigation
| Function | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `next_head(addr)` | Next defined item |
| `prev_head(addr)` | Previous defined item |

| Function | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `save()` | Save database to disk (after UPDATE/INSERT/DELETE) |

### Decompilation (HLIL)
| Function | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `decompile(addr)` | Full HLIL pseudocode for function at addr |
| `decompile(addr, limit)` | Pseudocode limited to N lines |
| `hlil_at(addr)` | HLIL text at specific address |
| `hlil_op_at(addr)` | HLIL operation name at address |

**IMPORTANT:** Use `decompile()`, NOT `hlil()` or `hlil_ssa()` - those don't exist!

---

## Common Query Patterns

### Find Most Called Functions

```sql
-- Direct JOIN is now efficient (uses filter_eq with GetCodeReferences)
SELECT f.name, COUNT(*) as callers
FROM funcs f
JOIN xrefs x ON x.to_ea = f.address
WHERE x.is_code = 1
GROUP BY f.address
ORDER BY callers DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

### Functions Called N Times or Less (Use CTE!)

**IMPORTANT:** Use a CTE to pre-aggregate xrefs, NOT a correlated subquery.

```sql
-- GOOD: Pre-aggregate with CTE (~800ms)
WITH call_counts AS (
    SELECT to_ea, COUNT(1) as cnt
    FROM xrefs
    WHERE is_code = 1
    GROUP BY to_ea
)
SELECT f.name, COALESCE(c.cnt, 0) as calls
FROM funcs f
LEFT JOIN call_counts c ON c.to_ea = f.address
WHERE COALESCE(c.cnt, 0) <= 10
ORDER BY calls DESC;

-- BAD: Correlated subquery (O(n×m) = very slow, will timeout!)
-- SELECT name, (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM xrefs WHERE to_ea = funcs.address) as calls FROM funcs;
```

### String Cross-Reference Analysis

```sql
SELECT s.content, func_at(x.from_ea) as used_by
FROM strings s
JOIN xrefs x ON s.address = x.to_ea
WHERE s.content LIKE '%password%';
```

### Function Complexity (by Block Count)

```sql
SELECT func_at(func_ea) as name, COUNT(*) as block_count
FROM blocks
GROUP BY func_ea
ORDER BY block_count DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

### Import Dependency Map

```sql
-- Which modules are used
SELECT module, COUNT(*) AS cnt FROM imports GROUP BY module ORDER BY cnt DESC;
```

### Security: Dangerous Function Imports

```sql
-- Find dangerous/suspicious imports
SELECT module, name FROM imports
WHERE name LIKE '%Shell%'
   OR name LIKE '%WinExec%'
   OR name LIKE '%CreateProcess%'
   OR name LIKE '%VirtualAlloc%'
   OR name IN ('strcpy', 'strcat', 'sprintf', 'gets');
```

### Crypto-related Imports

```sql
SELECT module, name FROM imports
WHERE name LIKE '%Crypt%'
   OR name LIKE '%Hash%'
   OR name LIKE '%AES%'
   OR name LIKE '%RSA%';
```

### Network-related Imports

```sql
SELECT module, name FROM imports
WHERE name LIKE '%socket%'
   OR name LIKE '%connect%'
   OR name LIKE '%send%'
   OR name LIKE '%recv%'
   OR name LIKE '%WSA%'
   OR name LIKE '%Http%';
```

## Complex Analysis Patterns

### Bridge Functions (High Connectivity)
Functions that act as bridges between subsystems - called by many and calling many:

```sql
WITH caller_counts AS (
    SELECT to_ea as func_addr, COUNT(DISTINCT from_func) as caller_cnt
    FROM xrefs WHERE is_code = 1 AND from_func != 0 GROUP BY to_ea
),
callee_counts AS (
    SELECT from_func as func_addr, COUNT(DISTINCT to_ea) as callee_cnt
    FROM xrefs WHERE is_code = 1 AND from_func != 0 GROUP BY from_func
)
SELECT f.name, COALESCE(cr.caller_cnt, 0) as callers, COALESCE(ce.callee_cnt, 0) as callees
FROM funcs f
LEFT JOIN caller_counts cr ON cr.func_addr = f.address
LEFT JOIN callee_counts ce ON ce.func_addr = f.address
WHERE COALESCE(cr.caller_cnt, 0) >= 5 AND COALESCE(ce.callee_cnt, 0) >= 5
ORDER BY (cr.caller_cnt * ce.callee_cnt) DESC LIMIT 20;
```

### Error Handler Detection
Functions with many callers that reference error-related strings:

```sql
-- Optimized pattern: pre-filter strings, then use EXISTS on cached xrefs
-- (Avoid string_refs view which iterates all strings)
WITH error_addrs AS (
    SELECT address FROM strings
    WHERE content LIKE '%error%' OR content LIKE '%fail%' OR content LIKE '%invalid%'
),
funcs_with_errors AS (
    SELECT DISTINCT x.from_func as func_addr
    FROM xrefs x
    WHERE x.from_func != 0
      AND EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM error_addrs e WHERE e.address = x.to_ea)
),
caller_counts AS (
    SELECT to_ea as func_addr, COUNT(*) as caller_cnt
    FROM xrefs WHERE is_code = 1 GROUP BY to_ea
)
SELECT f.name, COALESCE(cr.caller_cnt, 0) as callers
FROM funcs_with_errors fwe
JOIN funcs f ON f.address = fwe.func_addr
LEFT JOIN caller_counts cr ON cr.func_addr = f.address
WHERE COALESCE(cr.caller_cnt, 0) >= 5
ORDER BY cr.caller_cnt DESC LIMIT 15;
```

### Chokepoint Functions (Hook Targets)
Functions that dominate paths to output operations:

```sql
WITH write_funcs AS (
    SELECT address FROM imports
    WHERE name LIKE '%write%' OR name LIKE '%send%' OR name LIKE '%fwrite%'
),
caller_coverage AS (
    SELECT x.from_func as func_addr, COUNT(DISTINCT x.to_ea) as write_targets
    FROM xrefs x
    WHERE x.to_ea IN (SELECT address FROM write_funcs) AND x.from_func != 0
    GROUP BY x.from_func
)
SELECT f.name, cc.write_targets
FROM caller_coverage cc JOIN funcs f ON f.address = cc.func_addr
ORDER BY cc.write_targets DESC LIMIT 10;
```

## Hex Address Formatting

Binary Ninja uses integer addresses. For display, use `hex()`:

```sql
SELECT hex(address) as addr, name FROM funcs;
```

---

## Quick Start Examples

### "What does this binary do?"

```sql
-- Entry points
SELECT * FROM entries;

-- Imported APIs (hints at functionality)
SELECT module, name FROM imports ORDER BY module, name;

-- Interesting strings
SELECT content FROM strings WHERE length > 10 ORDER BY length DESC LIMIT 20;
```

### "Find security-relevant code"

```sql
-- Dangerous string functions
SELECT module, name FROM imports
WHERE name IN ('strcpy', 'strcat', 'sprintf', 'gets');

-- Crypto-related
SELECT * FROM imports WHERE name LIKE '%Crypt%' OR name LIKE '%Hash%';

-- Network-related
SELECT * FROM imports WHERE name LIKE '%socket%' OR name LIKE '%connect%';
```

### "Understand a specific function"

```sql
-- Basic info
SELECT * FROM funcs WHERE address = 0x401000;

-- What calls it
SELECT hex(from_ea) as caller FROM xrefs WHERE to_ea = 0x401000 AND is_code = 1;

-- Decompile it
SELECT decompile(0x401000);

-- Or with line limit
SELECT decompile(0x401000, 30);
```

### "Decompile and analyze a function"

```sql
-- Find a medium-sized function and decompile it
SELECT name, size, decompile(address, 40) FROM funcs
WHERE size BETWEEN 500 AND 2000 ORDER BY size LIMIT 1;

-- Get variables
SELECT name, type, storage FROM hlil_vars WHERE func_addr = 0x401000;

-- Get function calls made
SELECT DISTINCT callee_name FROM hlil_calls WHERE func_addr = 0x401000;
```

---

## Query Optimization Guidelines

### Critical: Decompiler Tables Are On-Demand

**IMPORTANT:** The `pseudocode`, `hlil_vars`, and `hlil_calls` tables are **virtual tables that decompile functions on-demand**. This means:

- Each row requires decompiling its containing function
- Unbounded queries iterate ALL functions and decompile EACH one
- Large binaries can have thousands of functions
- Unbounded queries will **hang or timeout**

**NEVER do this:**
```sql
-- BAD: Iterates all functions, decompiles each one - WILL HANG!
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM pseudocode;
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM hlil_vars;
SELECT * FROM hlil_calls LIMIT 10;  -- Still iterates from start!
```

**ALWAYS do this:**
```sql
-- GOOD: First get a function address, then query that function
SELECT address FROM funcs WHERE size > 100 LIMIT 1;  -- Get: 0x401000
SELECT * FROM pseudocode WHERE func_addr = 0x401000;
SELECT * FROM hlil_vars WHERE func_addr = 0x401000;
SELECT * FROM hlil_calls WHERE func_addr = 0x401000;
```

**Pattern for searching across decompiled code:**
```sql
-- Search requires iteration but filter early
SELECT DISTINCT func_at(func_addr) FROM pseudocode WHERE line LIKE '%password%';
-- Still iterates all, but finds matches. Use for targeted searches, not counts.
```

### Critical Performance Rules

1. **Decompiler tables:** ALWAYS filter by `func_addr = X` - unbounded queries cause hangs
2. **Instructions table:** Always filter by `func_addr = X` - never scan the whole table
3. **Xref counting:** Use CTEs to pre-aggregate, never correlated subqueries
4. **JOINs with xrefs:** Pre-aggregate xrefs in a CTE first, then JOIN to funcs
5. **Decompiler analysis:** Use `decompile()`, `hlil_vars`, `hlil_calls`, `pseudocode` - NOT the raw `hlil` table

### Decompiler Table Selection

| Need | Use This | NOT This |
|------|----------|----------|
| View pseudocode | `decompile(addr)` or `pseudocode WHERE func_addr=X` | - |
| Find variables | `hlil_vars WHERE func_addr = X` | - |
| Find function calls | `hlil_calls WHERE func_addr = X` | - |
| Search in decompiled code | `pseudocode WHERE line LIKE '%pattern%'` | - |
| AST analysis | `hlil_calls` + `hlil_vars` combined | `_hlil_ast` (expert only) |

**WARNING:** The `_hlil_ast` table (underscore prefix = internal/expert) contains raw HLIL AST nodes and generates many rows per function. For typical analysis, use `hlil_calls` and `hlil_vars` which provide the most useful information efficiently. Only use `_hlil_ast` for advanced AST pattern matching - see "Advanced: HLIL AST Table" section.

### Why CTEs Matter for Xref Queries

The `xrefs` table can have thousands of rows. A correlated subquery like:
```sql
-- SLOW: Executes subquery for EACH function (O(n×m))
SELECT name, (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM xrefs WHERE to_ea = funcs.address) FROM funcs;
```

Instead, pre-aggregate once with a CTE:
```sql
-- FAST: Single pass over xrefs, then hash join (O(n+m))
WITH counts AS (SELECT to_ea, COUNT(*) as n FROM xrefs GROUP BY to_ea)
SELECT f.name, COALESCE(c.n, 0) FROM funcs f LEFT JOIN counts c ON c.to_ea = f.address;
```

## REPL Commands

When running in interactive mode (`bnsql database.bndb -i`), these dot-commands are available:

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `.tables` | List all virtual tables |
| `.schema [table]` | Show table schema |
| `.info` | Show database metadata |
| `.quit` / `.exit` | Exit REPL |
| `.help` | Show available commands |
| `.http start` | Start HTTP server on random port |
| `.http stop` | Stop HTTP server |
| `.http status` | Show HTTP server status |
| `.agent` | Start AI agent mode |

---

## Server Modes

BNSQL supports two server protocols for remote queries: **HTTP REST** (recommended) and raw TCP.

---

### HTTP REST Server (Recommended)

Standard REST API that works with curl, any HTTP client, or LLM tools.

**Starting the server:**
```bash
# Default port 8081
bnsql database.bndb --http

# Custom port and bind address
bnsql database.bndb --http 9000 --bind 0.0.0.0

# With authentication
bnsql database.bndb --http 8081 --token mysecret
```

**HTTP Endpoints:**

| Endpoint | Method | Auth | Description |
|----------|--------|------|-------------|
| `/` | GET | No | Welcome message |
| `/help` | GET | No | API documentation (for LLM discovery) |
| `/query` | POST | Yes* | Execute SQL (body = raw SQL) |
| `/status` | GET | Yes* | Health check |
| `/shutdown` | POST | Yes* | Stop server |

*Auth required only if `--token` was specified.

**Example with curl:**
```bash
# Get API documentation
curl http://localhost:8081/help

# Execute SQL query
curl -X POST http://localhost:8081/query -d "SELECT name, size FROM funcs LIMIT 5"

# With authentication
curl -X POST http://localhost:8081/query \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer mysecret" \
     -d "SELECT * FROM funcs"

# Check status
curl http://localhost:8081/status
```

**Response Format (JSON):**
```json
{"success": true, "columns": ["name", "size"], "rows": [["main", "500"]], "row_count": 1}
```

```json
{"success": false, "error": "no such table: bad_table"}
```

---

### Raw TCP Server (Legacy)

Binary protocol with length-prefixed JSON. Use only when HTTP is not available.

**Starting the server:**
```bash
bnsql database.bndb --server 13337
bnsql database.bndb --server 13337 --token mysecret
```

**Connecting as client:**
```bash
bnsql --remote localhost:13337 -c "SELECT name FROM funcs LIMIT 5"
bnsql --remote localhost:13337 -i
```

**Wire Protocol:**
- Format: `[4-byte length (big-endian uint32)] [JSON payload]`
- Request: `{"sql": "SELECT ...", "token": "optional"}`
- Response: `{"success": true, "columns": [...], "rows": [[...]], "row_count": N}`

**Python Example:**
```python
import socket, struct, json

def bnsql_query(sql, host="localhost", port=13337, token=None):
    s = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
    s.connect((host, port))
    req = {"sql": sql}
    if token: req["token"] = token
    payload = json.dumps(req).encode()
    s.sendall(struct.pack(">I", len(payload)) + payload)
    resp_len = struct.unpack(">I", s.recv(4))[0]
    return json.loads(s.recv(resp_len))
```

## Advanced: HLIL AST Table (_hlil_ast)

The `_hlil_ast` table provides access to raw HLIL Abstract Syntax Tree nodes. The underscore prefix indicates this is an **internal/expert** table - use it only when you need AST-level pattern matching that `hlil_calls` and `hlil_vars` cannot provide.

### When to Use _hlil_ast

| Need | Preferred Approach |
|------|-------------------|
| Find function calls | `hlil_calls` (use this!) |
| Find variables | `hlil_vars` (use this!) |
| Find loops/conditions | `_hlil_ast` views |
| AST pattern matching | `_hlil_ast` with filtering |

### Critical: Always Filter by func_addr

Like all decompiler tables, `_hlil_ast` decompiles functions on-demand. **NEVER query without a func_addr filter:**

```sql
-- BAD: Will iterate all functions and generate MANY rows per function
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM _hlil_ast;

-- GOOD: Always filter by specific function
SELECT * FROM _hlil_ast WHERE func_addr = 0x401000;
```

### Available Views

Pre-filtered views for common AST patterns (all require `func_addr` filter):

| View | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `_hlil_ast_loops` | WHILE, DO_WHILE, FOR loops |
| `_hlil_ast_ifs` | IF/ELSE conditions |
| `_hlil_ast_comparisons` | Comparison operations |
| `_hlil_ast_assignments` | Assignment statements |
| `_hlil_ast_returns` | Return statements |
| `_hlil_ast_derefs` | Pointer dereferences |
| `_hlil_ast_constants` | Constant values |
| `_hlil_ast_vars` | Variable references |

### Example: Find Loops in a Function

```sql
-- Get a function address first
SELECT address FROM funcs WHERE size > 500 LIMIT 1;  -- e.g., 0x401330

-- Query loops in that function
SELECT op_name, hex(ea) as addr, cond_id, body_id
FROM _hlil_ast_loops
WHERE func_addr = 0x401330;
```

### Example: Find All IF Conditions

```sql
SELECT op_name, hex(ea) as addr, cond_id, true_id, false_id
FROM _hlil_ast_ifs
WHERE func_addr = 0x401330;
```

### Recommendation

For 99% of use cases, prefer:
- `decompile(addr)` - to view pseudocode
- `hlil_calls` - to find function calls
- `hlil_vars` - to find variables
- `pseudocode WHERE line LIKE '%pattern%'` - to search in decompiled code

Only use `_hlil_ast` and its views for specialized AST analysis tasks.

---

## Output Guidelines

### ALWAYS Show Actual Data

When the user asks to see something (decompilation, code, data), **ALWAYS include the actual output** in your response - don't just describe it!

**BAD (don't do this):**
> "The function appears to call malloc and contains a loop..."

**GOOD (do this):**
```
int64_t sub_401000() {
    void* ptr = malloc(0x100);
    for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
        process(ptr, i);
    }
    return 0;
}
```

### Decompilation Requests

When the user asks to "decompile" or "show the code":
1. Run `SELECT decompile(address)` or `SELECT decompile(address, 50)` for longer output
2. **Include the actual pseudocode output** in a code block
3. Then optionally add analysis

Example response format:
```
## Function: sub_401000 (500 bytes)

### Pseudocode:
\`\`\`c
int64_t sub_401000(int64_t arg1) {
    if (arg1 == 0) return -1;
    ...actual code here...
}
\`\`\`

### Analysis:
- This function validates the input argument...
```

---

## CRITICAL REMINDERS (Read Before Every Query)

- **JOINs on xrefs.to_ea are fast:** `JOIN xrefs x ON x.to_ea = f.address` uses direct BN API (GetCodeReferences)
- **Xref GROUP BY → Use CTE for efficiency:** `WITH counts AS (SELECT to_ea, COUNT(*) as n FROM xrefs WHERE is_code=1 GROUP BY to_ea) SELECT ...`
- **NEVER use `func_start()`/`func_at()` in bulk xref queries** - each call = 1 API request = minutes of waiting
- **Call graph analysis → Use `from_func` column or `callers`/`callees` views** - NOT `func_start()` on xrefs
- **Decompiler tables → ALWAYS filter by func_addr** - unbounded = hang
- **Instructions table → ALWAYS filter by func_addr** - unbounded = extremely slow
- **Use `decompile(addr)` for pseudocode** - not raw tables
- **Use `hlil_vars` and `hlil_calls`** - not raw `_hlil_ast` unless needed

### Quick Reference: Slow vs Fast Patterns

| Task | SLOW (avoid) | FAST (use this) |
|------|--------------|-----------------|
| Find callers of function X | N/A | `xrefs WHERE to_ea = X` (uses direct API) |
| Count callers per function | `func_start(from_ea)` on xrefs | `SELECT to_ea, COUNT(*) FROM xrefs WHERE is_code=1 GROUP BY to_ea` |
| Count callees per function | `callees` view (has joins) | `SELECT from_func, COUNT(DISTINCT to_ea) FROM xrefs WHERE is_code=1 GROUP BY from_func` |
| JOIN funcs with xref callers | N/A | `JOIN xrefs x ON x.to_ea = f.address` (uses direct API per function) |
| Find what X calls | `callees WHERE func_addr = X` | `xrefs WHERE from_func = X AND is_code = 1` |
| Bulk call graph analysis | `callees`/`callers` views | Use `xrefs` with `from_func` directly |
| Get names at the end | Join `funcs` in every CTE | Join `funcs` only in final SELECT |

---

## Summary: When to Use What

| Goal | Table/Function |
|------|----------------|
| List all functions | `funcs` |
| Find who calls what | `xrefs` with `is_code = 1` |
| Find data references | `xrefs` with `is_code = 0` |
| Analyze imports | `imports` |
| Find strings | `strings` |
| Instruction analysis | `instructions WHERE func_addr = X` |
| Binary metadata | `db_info` |
| **Decompile a function** | `decompile(addr)` or `decompile(addr, limit)` |
| **Find local variables** | `hlil_vars WHERE func_addr = X` |
| **Find function calls (HLIL)** | `hlil_calls WHERE func_addr = X` |
| **Search pseudocode** | `pseudocode WHERE line LIKE '%pattern%'` |

**Remember:** Always use `func_addr = X` constraints on `instructions`, `hlil_vars`, `hlil_calls`, and `pseudocode` tables.
